Leap Pong!
=========

A 2 player pong game for LeapMotion.

## What is it?
This is a sersiouly simple implementation of the classic game, allowing the LeapMotion to control the 2 paddles. The game continues indefinetely as there is currently no _top score_ feature.

**Things it does:**
1. Skews the ball in the Y axis depending on the movement of the paddles
2. Counts each player's score
3. Detects movements over 1mm

**Things it doesn't do**
1. Perfect ball skewing
2. Work off exact values for the ball bumping off the sides and paddles
3. Make you more attractive to the opposite sex 

## Disclaimer
I'm a web-developer and I know I'm going to hell for not using a seperate style-sheet. This code is also provided as-is - it should work, but it might not, and any embarrasement caused by bugs isn't my fault, but I'll be happy to pull in useful changes or look into random bugs.

Enjoy and let me know your thoughts!
